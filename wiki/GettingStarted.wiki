== Download the LinqToExcel project zip file ==

  * The latest file can be downloaded from this link: [http://code.google.com/p/linqtoexcel/downloads/list]
  * Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file into a directory that can easily be referenced by your project
    * Make sure you keep all the extracted files in the same directory since the LinqToExcel library depends on these other files being there

== Reference LinqToExcel ==

  * Add a reference to the _LinqToExcel.dll_ and _Remotion.Data.Linq.dll_ libraries to your project
    * These files are contained in the extracted directory you created in the step above

== Create a class ==

  * Have the class property names match the spreadsheet column names

=== Spreadsheet Example ===
||*FirstName*||*LastName*||*BirthDate*||
||Jane||Doe||10/16/1972||
||John||Smith||4/15/1967||

The first row of the spreadsheet must contain the column headers

=== Class Example ===
{{{
public class Person
{
   public string FirstName { get; set; }
   public string LastName { get; set; }
   public DateTime BirthDate { get; set; }
}
}}}

{{{
var repo = new LinqToExcel.ExcelQueryFactory();
repo.FileName = "pathToExcelFile";
var people = from p in repo.Worksheet<Person>()
             select p;
}}}
