== Property to Column Mapping ==
If your class properties do not match the spreadsheet column names, then you can map the property names to the desired column names. The code below maps the _State_ property on the _Company_ class to the column named _Providence_ in the spreadsheet.
{{{
var repo = new ExcelQueryFactory("excelFileName");
repo.AddMapping<Company>(x => x.State, "Providence");

var indianaCompanies = from c in repo.Worksheet<Company>()
                       c.State == "IN"
                       select c;
}}}


== Worksheet Name ==
By default, LinqToExcel retrieves data from the default worksheet named "Sheet1". To retrieve data from a worksheet with another name just pass the sheet name as an argument to the _Worksheet_ method. The code below retrieves data from the worksheet named "Last Quarter"
{{{
var repo = new ExcelQueryFactory("excelFileName");

var companiesThatLostMoney = from c in repo.Worksheet<Company>("Last Quarter")
                             where c.Earnings < 0
                             select c;
}}}
